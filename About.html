<h1>Welcome </h1>
            <p>This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if society
                 is to take full advantage <br>
                 of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer science involves the study and development of <br>
                 applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support these applications, and the means 
                 and methods used to produce<br>
                  both applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies the skill of computer programming and <br>
                  employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools and 
                 the ability to apply sound engineering<br>
                 principles to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.<br><br>
                The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired by students enable them to find employment in many diverse fields of the economy <br>
                 and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team (or research and development team), and to enable the graduate to bring <br>
                 specialist 
                skills to that team. The course also provides the platform for further study or research through exposure to established and emerging technologies <br>
                and methods, and to active fields of research in Computer Science.
                The Department offers two undergraduate degree <br> programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. </p>
