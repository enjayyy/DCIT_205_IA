## Introduction

This repository contains the codebase for a 10-page website dedicated to the Computer Science Department. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of my web development skills and showcase a comprehensive understanding of computer science resources. Leveraging the school's existing website as a foundation, I have undertaken the task of redesigning a more contemporary and user-friendly version.

## Take Aways
CHALLENGES AND KEY TAKEAWAYS
1. Working with Version Control(Git)
Challenge 
 Initial set up, Managing changes, resolving conflicts, and maintaining a clean Git history.

Solution
On facing these challenges,it was crucial for me to delve into comprehensive research on efficiently setting up a repository. I adopted a systematic approach by committing changes regularly and ensuring each commit carries a meaningful message. As conflicts arose, I promptly addressed them, maintaining a commitment to established Git best practices throughout the development process for effective version control.

2. Web Responsiveness Techniques
Challenge
Designing a website that seamlessly caters to diverse devices and screen sizes. This involves fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries to create an optimal viewing experience.

Solution
In the pursuit of an efficient and consistent responsive design, I've leveraged CSS principles and media queries in ensuring that the layout adjusts dynamically.

3. Efficient use of Inheritance and Classes

4. The importance of Git commiting in restoring older versions of a code.

5. Backup and Recovery Preparedness
I've learnt to be prepared for unexpected data loss scenarios.Regularly perform data backups, automate backup processes, and maintain a documented disaster recovery plan for swift restoration in emergencies.
